# Slackmojis

## Purpose

This repository contains a collection of popular emojis with instructions on
mass upload to a Slack workspace, whether you're a computer expert or not!

Current emojis include Blobs (`:blob-xxx:`), Shiblobs (`:shiblob-xxx:`), Party
everything (`:party-xxx:`), and much more! Each collection of emojis is located
in their own folder.

Please note that you must have the necessary privileges to upload emojis - see
the [Slack Help
Center](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/206870177-add-custom-emoji)
for more details.

## Requirements

To facilitate mass uploads of 100 at a time, it is strongly considered to install the
[Neutral Face
emoji](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neutral-face-emoji-tools/anchoacphlfbdomdlomnbbfhcmcdmjej)
extension, or another browsers equivalent.

## Tutorial

1. Ensure you are logged into the correct Slack workspace
1. Clone or [download this
   repository](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/slackmojis/archive/master.zip) to
   your local machine. If you have downloaded the `.zip` file, unzip it using a
   third-party or built-in tool made for extracting archives.
1. From within your Slack workspace, click on the Workspace name and
   click `Customize Slack`. Your web browser should open a new tab directly to
   the `Customize Your Workspace` page.
1. If you have not installed the Chrome extension for mass uploading emojis, see
   the [Requirements](#requirements) section
1. Open finder or windows explorer, select up to 100 emojis and drag and drop
   them into the Bulk Emoji Uploader section

- GIFs over 100 kb will result in a `too many frames` error - use
  [Ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/optimize) to scale down images over 100 kb
